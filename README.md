# Fuyuko
Fuyuko's Adventures.

Small indie game developped for school. 
Requires haxe, openfl, lime, and haxeflixel to compile.
Developped with Visual Studio Code with neko and cpp (on OSX) as main targets.
Might work on html5/flash too.


Playable prototype at:

tl;dr: use hxcpp 3.4.64 when building on osx
