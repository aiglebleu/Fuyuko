     the original image had 4 bits per primary color available to create
     the image.  This value should be set to indicate the richness of

     decreasing importance. Typically, the order would be decreasing
     frequency, with most frequent color first. This assists a decoder,
     with fewer available colors, in choosing the best subset of colors;
     the decoder may use an initial segment of the table to render the
     graphic.
